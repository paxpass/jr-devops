# Paxform DevOps & Backend Engineer Challenge Summary

## 📌 Challenge Overview

**Focus**: This is primarily a **DevOps assessment** (70% weight). Clean, scalable infrastructure code is as important as clean PHP code.

**Project**: Build and deploy a containerized "Secure Drop" service - a burn-after-reading secret sharing application.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

Build a robust, containerized "Secure Drop" service using Laravel and deploy it using a production-ready Docker Compose & Traefik architecture.

**Feature**: Users can send a sensitive string (password/API key), receive a unique link, and share it. Once viewed, the data is permanently deleted.

---

## 🔧 Part 1: Backend Requirements

### Framework
- Use **Laravel 10 or 11**

### Architecture Pattern
- **Service-Repository Pattern** (mandatory)5
- Strict separation of concerns:
  - Business logic → Service layer
  - Database queries → Repository layer

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Create Secret
- **Method**: `POST /api/v1/secrets`
- **Input**: 
  - `text` (required): The secret content
  - `ttl` (optional): Time-to-live in seconds
- **Output**: Returns unique ID/URL for sharing

#### 2. Retrieve Secret (Burn on Read)
- **Method**: `GET /api/v1/secrets/{id}`
- **Output**: Returns decrypted text
- **Critical**: Permanently deletes the record after retrieval

### Security Requirements
- ✅ Text content **must be encrypted** in database
- ✅ Use **secure, non-sequential IDs** (UUIDs or Nanoids)

### Documentation
- ✅ Auto-generate API docs (Scribe or Swagger)
- ✅ Accessible at `/docs` endpoint

---

## 🐳 Part 2: DevOps Requirements (CORE ASSESSMENT)

This is the **main focus** of the evaluation.

### A. Containerization

#### Dockerfile Requirements
1. **Multi-Stage Build**
   - Keep final image size small
   - Optimize for production

2. **Security**
   - Run application as **non-root user**
   - No root privileges in container

3. **PHP Extensions**
   - Must include: BCMath, PCNTL
   - Include all necessary Laravel extensions

#### Docker Compose Strategy (CRITICAL)
Must use **multi-file strategy** to separate concerns:

1. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Base configuration
   - Services, Networks, Volumes

2. **docker-compose.override.yml**
   - Local development overrides
   - Ports exposure
   - Bind mounts for live code

3. **docker-compose.prod.yml**
   - Production overrides
   - Restart policies
   - NO bind mounts (code baked in image)

### B. Infrastructure & Orchestration

#### 1. Traefik Reverse Proxy (MANDATORY)
- Application **must** sit behind Traefik
- Configure routing using **Docker Labels** on app container
- App accessible via hostname:
  - Local: `secure-drop.localhost` (or similar)
  - Production: Real domain name

#### 2. Health Checks
- Implement health check in docker-compose
- Ensure app is ready before receiving traffic
- Check database/service dependencies

### C. CI/CD Pipeline

Create pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions preferred) with these stages:

#### 1. Lint & Test
- Run PHP linter (Pint or phpcs)
- Run tests: `php artisan test`

#### 2. Security Scan
- Scan Docker image for vulnerabilities
- Use tools like **Trivy**

#### 3. Build & Push
- Build Docker image
- Push to registry (Docker Hub or GHCR)

#### 4. Deployment (BONUS)
- Script/step to trigger deployment on VPS
- Automated or semi-automated

---

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### VPS Deployment (MANDATORY)
- Deploy to public VPS:
  - AWS Free Tier
  - DigitalOcean
  - Any similar cloud provider

### Production Requirements
- ✅ Application running behind Traefik
- ✅ Provide **Live URL** in submission
- ✅ Accessible for testing

---

## 📝 Submission Instructions

### 1. Base Repository
- Fork: https://github.com/paxpass/jr-devops

### 2. Pull Request
- Submit solution as PR to `main` branch of base repo

### 3. PR Description MUST Include:

#### a. Live Deployment URL ⭐
- Working URL where evaluators can test the API

#### b. Architectural Decisions Summary
- Explain key decisions made
- Why certain technologies/approaches chosen

#### c. Local Setup Instructions ⭐
- **One-command setup** preferred
- Clear step-by-step if multi-step

#### d. Traefik Configuration Explanation ⭐
- How routing is configured
- How labels are used
- Local vs Production differences

#### e. CI/CD Pipeline Instructions
- How to trigger pipeline
- What each stage does
- How to interpret results

---

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Infrastructure Quality (HIGH WEIGHT)
